# Pop-The-Bubbles-
Pop the bubbles game written in JQuery :game_die::video_game::balloon:

I created this game back in 2016 and only commited it fairly recently. It was a task just to create a game where you could pop the bubbles.
It comes with a countdown and even tracks your score.

### To do/Improvements
There are so many things to improve about this! I wouldn't use Jquery and it'd be great to write it in either vanilla Javascript or use a framework to do it.
I'm proud of it though as it was one of the first projects that I wrote.
